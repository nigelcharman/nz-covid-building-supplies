# Level 4 - Public customers

As a public customer under level 4, I want to buy essential goods so that I can make some essential repairs.

## Essential goods

I can buy an essential good in stock online.

The government relies on businesses to determine which goods are essential.

Essential goods include:

* urgently required white ware and appliances: such as fridges, heaters, washing machines and dryers, vacuum cleaners, fans and dehumidifiers
* urgently required cooking, cleaning and laundry equipment
* materials for urgent home repair

Non-essential goods include:

* entertainment and hobby products: such as gaming consoles and swings
